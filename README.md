### Hey, I’m Suyash 👋

CS undergrad at Delhi Technological University (DTU), currently in my third year.  
I build projects that help me learn, solve real problems, and sometimes break stuff — intentionally.

### 🚧 What I'm Working On

- **SmartStocks** — an in-progress algo-trading tool with a FastAPI backend, MongoDB storage, and a React-based dashboard.  
- Internal dev tooling, deployment experiments, and a few personal utilities I might open-source later.

---

### ⚙️ What I Like Working With

- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, C++  
- **Frameworks & Tools:** FastAPI, Node.js, React, Tailwind  
- **Infra/DevOps:** Railway, Vercel, MongoDB Atlas

Clean architecture > clever hacks. I care more about why something works than just how.

### 🧠 Learning Goals Right Now

- Scalable backend design  
- Real-time systems (websockets, event-driven pipelines)  
- Finetuning frontend UX for actual users
